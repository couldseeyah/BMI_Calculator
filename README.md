### Description 📝
BMI Calculator is a mobile application designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input. This project is part of one of the modules in [The App Brewery's Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp](https://www.appbrewery.co/), and it builds upon the basic project provided in the course.

### Features ✨
- Calculates BMI based on user-entered weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Provides interpretation of BMI results, indicating whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
- Offers a simple and intuitive user interface for quick and easy BMI calculation.
- For adults, BMI is calculated using standard formulas based on height and weight.
- For children, BMI category boundaries (normal weight, overweight, etc.) are estimated using data from the growth-age charts available at [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/).

### Usage 🚀
To run the app:
1. Initialize your emulated device (Android Studio, etc.) or connect a mobile device configured to developer mode.
2. Run the app from VS Code's debug mode.
